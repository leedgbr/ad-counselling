        <h1>Perinatal Counselling</h1>
        <p>I am a qualified counsellor and practicing midwife based in Melbourne who has a special interest in working
            with clients in the perinatal period to provide emotional support for any challenges that women and families
            may be facing from the pre-pregnancy stage right up until the early postnatal period.</p>
        <p>With over 15 years experience of supporting couples through their pregnancy journey I have combined my
            passion as a midwife and a counsellor to provide talking therapies in an empathic and non-judgemental manner
            at a time when women and their partners can feel very vulnerable and overwhelmed.</p>

            <h1>Approach</h1>
            <p>The journey into parenthood is by all means not an easy one. For some people it seems like a smooth
                transition but for others it is an emotional roller coaster ride. Being able to talk to someone about
                the challenges that you are facing during the pregnancy and after giving birth and becoming a parent can
                help to find some clarity.</p>
            <p>While some things may be out of our control I strongly believe that every individual has the potential to
                achieve a positive and balanced outlook on life and have the necessary skills to tackle all the
                different roadblocks that we are faced with, especially when it comes to being parent's and starting a
                family. I know my own personal transition in parenthood was certainly not easy and having someone
                validate my own personal feelings and provide support helped me immensely.</p>
            <p>Of course there are some journeys into parenthood that are faced with many challenges such as miscarriage
                or difficulties becoming pregnant. The loss of a much loved and wanted baby or an unexpected birth
                experience can all cause a certain degree of trauma. All of these experiences can greatly affect our
                ability to move forward and feel positive about the future. Focusing on the individual or couple and
                working with them through talking therapies can help to ease the pain and suffering that they may be
                experiencing.</p>
            <p>By adopting a person centred approach to counselling, individuals and couples can work through any
                challenges that they are facing so that they are able to find that common ground to be able to carry on
                with everyday life in a more positive and balanced manner.</p>
            <p>I am also interested in helping individuals and couples work through any challenging decisions that they
                are facing. For example this can be trying to decide between a vaginal or ceasarean birth, whether to
                breastfeed or bottle feed their newborn baby and what support people to have present at the birth to
                name a few. By adopting a solution focused approach to therapy this can greatly help to empower clients
                to make these important decisions.</p>
            <p>I also believe that counselling should be accessible to everyone not just to those living in the city but
                also more regional and remote areas and interstate so I am happy to extend my services via telephone
                counselling and also via Skype/Zoom to those who feel they need. This is also available to those living
                in the city where travelling to an appointment may not be convenient for various reasons.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>As a practicing midwife I have a real passion to help women and their partners through their labour and birth
            experience. However after working in this capacity for the past fifteen years I started to notice that there
            was a gap in the emotional health and well being of the couples that I was caring for. Many showing
            increased
            anxiety and concerns relating to their pregnancy and the worries that they are facing about transitioning to
            parenthood. Even the emotional turmoil of becoming pregnant was becoming more evident in some couples when
            they presented to give birth to their baby. This is what inspired me to become a qualified counsellor as I
            truly believe that this experience can be significantly improved if families have a healthy mind and body
            leading into their pregnancy journey and beyond into the postnatal period.</p>
        <p>I am currently working as a birth suite midwife in one of Melbourne's most well known private hospitals and
            have more recently taken on the role of bereavement midwife which I share alongside another colleague of the
            hospital. Together we provide support to families who have experienced the loss of their baby at different
            stages of their pregnancy and also to provide support to families who have had a very traumatic birth
            experience or have received an unexpected diagnosis regarding their baby or pregnancy.</p>
        <p>I am also very fortunate to be working alongside some of Melbourne's most well known obstetricians and have
            been fortunate enough to secure counselling rooms in a group practice that provides holistic care including
            female obstetricians, midwives, dietitians, lactation consultant and consultant gynaecologists. I also work
            in
            conjunction with two of Melbourne's finest obstetricians in a clinic providing support to families who have
            had either a previous premature birth, multiple miscarriage or loss of a baby as a counsellor providing
            extra support in their current pregnancy.</p>
        <p>My qualifications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diploma of Counselling</li>
            <li>Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery</li>
            <li>Bachelor of Science (Nursing)</li>
            <li>Childbirth Education Certificate from the Royal Women's hospital</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am also a member of the Australian Counselling Association and Registered with AHPRA (Australian Health
            Practitioner Regulation Agency).</p>
        <p>I have a strong passion for learning and am regularly attending workshops and conferences to enhance my
            practice and provide quality care.</p>
        <p>My interests of counselling in the perinatal period include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perinatal Anxiety</li>
            <li>Unexpected birth experience</li>
            <li>Grief and Loss</li>
            <li>Miscarriage</li>
            <li>Early Parenting adjustment</li>
            <li>Family Challenges</li>
            <li>Pregnancy after loss</li>
            <li>Bereavement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where it was once considered taboo to talk about any issues arising in the perinatal period such as anxiety
            and depression our focus has now shifted to the opposite way of thinking and I strongly urge any parents who
            are struggling in any way to get help. Simply talking is a good place to start.</p>
